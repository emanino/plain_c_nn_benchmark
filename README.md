# Plain C Neural Network Verification Benchmark

A collection of neural networks implemented in plain C language, paired with formal specifications of their properties.

## Producing the benchmarks

The resulting benchmark suite consists in single preprocessed files (i.e., `*.i`*) that includes all libraries (except verification intrinsics) and a benchmark `*.yml` description for `benchexec`.

### Dependencies

On an Ubuntu 22.04, the following command will install all dependecies:

`apt install build-essential cmake gcc-multilib`


### Compiling

To generate the benchmarks:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4 install
```

The benchmarks will be inside `./build/export`

## File Structure

1. **./includes/keras2c** contains the implementation of several types of neural network layers. These are used by networks converted via the keras2c tool: currently, polynomial approximation and hopfield networks belong to this category.

2. **./includes/musl_math** contains the MUSL mathematical library (except for complex number functions) in plain C. This has been extracted from the MUSL implementation of the C standard library.

3. **./networks** contains the neural network code in plain C. All networks in  **/hopfield_nets** and **/poly_approx** depend on the keras2c layer described above. In contrast, all networks in **/reach_prob_density** and **/reinforcement_learning** have been converted with the onnx2c tool, which requires no dependencies.

4. **./properties** contains the safety properties. Each property is specified as a main() C function with a precondition, a call to the neural network (or mathematical function) and a postcondition. The precondition and postcondition are expressed in ESBMC format. Each filename contains the expected result of the verification process: unsafe means that there exists at least one input to the neural network (or mathematical function) that lies in the precondition region but violates the postcondition.

## Compiling manually

. All benchmarks depends on the implementation of `includes/verifier_functions.h`, tools that already support SV-COMP standard should work out-of-box. Other tools will need to implement their custom
version of the library and link it at the `gcc` invokation. See `includes/verifier_stubs.c` for an example. and they all depend on an implementation of the verifier. 

Finally, each category of our benchmark has different dependencies
